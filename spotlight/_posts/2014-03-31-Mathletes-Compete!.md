The second annual Best in Class Math Competition was as fun-filled and exciting as ever! The competition was filled with surprises as over one hundred students from Best in Class’ Washington state centers competed for first prize. Showing off their hard-earned mathematics skills, students strove to win a Best in Class Math Competition Trophy. Students arrived at the competition eager, excited, and of course, a little nervous to take the written test in the first round. While students vigorously calculated and problem solved, family and friends got the opportunity to meet with local affiliates and sponsors. Our program featured booths by Art Program instructors Haesung Yoon and Karen Yuen, chess lessons from Chess4Life, free photography from Benz Photography, and martial arts demonstrations by Seattle Shaolin Kung Fu Academy.

Our event also helped to raise over $2,700 that was shared between Seattle Children’s Hospital and VT Seva. Thank you so much for being a part of this great cause, and a very special thank you to our sponsors, Eastside Family Counseling and MetLife!

After the first round of exams, we invited twelve students from each grade level on stage and congratulated them with a huge round of applause. Each student received a certificate of achievement for their accomplishment. These students had just qualified for the semi-final round, an even more challenging written exam.

Following the semi-final exams, the top six finalists from each grade level competed for the top spot on stage in front of a live audience! Each student anxiously held a hand over the buzzer in anticipation of the next question. Parents and students watched excitedly as the finalists strove for quickness and accuracy.

After the final on-stage competition, the top six finalists from each grade level were presented with a prize on the main stage. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners received shining trophies. The 4th, 5th, and 6th place winners received beautiful, engraved medals. The room was full of applause and smiles as everyone looked upon the BC math competition finalists.

It was great to see so many smiling students on stage after a long day of hard work. Congratulations to everyone who participated; we know that it wasn’t easy! We’d first like to thank the students for a job well done.  Of course, we’d like to thank all of the parents for supporting and encouraging your students.  We are also especially grateful for this year’s sponsors, Eastside Family Counseling, and MetLife. 

We hope to see all of you again next year!
