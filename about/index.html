      <h2>A Man With a Vision</h2>
      <p>Best in Class CEO Hao Lam grew up in South Vietnam. With communism approaching Lam, who is of Chinese descent, had his sights set on a different future, and successfully escaped Vietnam in 1988. After spending more than a year on a difficult journey as a refugee, speaking but a few words of English, Lam received a Canadian sponsorship where he then learned the language, graduated high school with a strikingly high GPA and received a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from the University of British Columbia.</p>
      <p>Throughout his time in Canada, Lam became well known in his community for the calculus tutoring that was preparing fellow classmates to pass challenging exams. Among the many things he learned throughout his winding journey to the West was that even when everything you have is taken from you it is impossible for anyone to take away your knowledge. He was passionate about spreading knowledge for this reason, and continues to draw from that passion today.</p>
      <p>It was when Lam received his degree at the age of 27 that his entrepreneurial spirit kicked in, and he and his wife Lisa lam headed to Seattle, where he opened and operated a Brainchild Education tutoring center as a licensee.</p>
      <p>Lamâ€™s satisfaction from tutoring students and seeing them catch up with their fellow classmates turned into providing them with the tools to zoom far ahead. Like falling dominos, this satisfaction spurred the creation of new enrichment programs and college preparatory programs, and hiring qualified instructors in other subjects aside from math, additional centers, and new staff and resources. Lam went from spreading the gift of education to Seattle students, to sharing it with students through more than 25 centers across the United States.</p>
      <p>Lam believes that education is the single best gift we can give to our children, and this mantra is fostered by each member of the Best in Class team to ensure that every student becomes wealthy with a passion for learning and develops the tools necessary to achieve his or her highest level of academic success.</p>
