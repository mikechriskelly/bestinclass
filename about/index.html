      <h3>Educators with a Vision</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8">
         <p>We started small. If you trace it all the way to the very beginning, before our first center even opened, you could say that Best in Class started as a value held dear to Hao and Lisa Lam. Above all else, the Lams believe that education is the gift of a lifetime.</p>
         <p>The value of education is personal for Hao. After he and Lisa fled Vietnam's communist government in the late 1980s, he worked tirelessly to put himself through school at the University of British Columbia, where he graduated at the top of his class with a BA in Mathematics. During that time, he tutored his classmates through complex coursework and difficult exams. It was like a spark ignitedâ€”Hao knew that educating others was his ultimate passion in life.</p>
         <p>Best in Class opened its first center in 1995 in the heart of Seattle. Since then, the company has grown rapidly, offering an ever wider range of programs and serving 28 communities and counting across the United States.</p>
         <p>In nearly two decades, Hao and Lisa's hard work has paid off. Best in Class is flourishing, continuing to expand and help more and more students reach their highest levels of academic success. But they're not stopping there. Hao wakes up at 5 o'clock each morning, regularly putting in 14-hour days in an effort to build an even better company.</p>
         <p>"It never feels like I'm working," he will tell you, grinning ear to ear. "I'm always happy. I am proud of my beautiful, supportive wife and my two wonderful boys, Louis and Albert. I am around my family and my incredible Best in Class team all the time. They inspire me, they encourage me, they challenge me, and they support me. We are making people's lives a little bit better every day. There's nothing better than that."</p>
