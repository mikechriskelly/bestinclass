    <h2>Beginners Classes</h2>
    <p>This is a flexible program designed to give children (ages 3 to 5) the best possible foundation and a passion for learning that will prepare them for success as they enter kindergarten. Students will either attend class twice per week for 35-minute sessions or once a week for 70 minutes. Parents have the option to enroll students to focus on math, English or both.</p>
    <p>Students will receive individualized support from instructors as they work to master a basic understanding in core areas including number and letter recognition and logic. Interaction with both the instructor and other students builds confidence and promotes active learning.</p>
