    <h2>Show your little one the joy of learning.</h2>
    <p>Pre-Kindergarten students learn letter recognition and an introduction to phonics, vocabulary, shape recognition, number recognition and counting concepts with individualized attention. Theyâ€™ll also build on core basics by focusing on logic and problem solving through puzzles and games. Collectively, this builds confidence and makes the experience fun for our students.
    <p>Flexible scheduling allows parents to choose a single 70-minute session or two 35-minute sessions as well as options to focus on math or English to ensure every child can be his or her best in an active learning environment.</p>
