    <p>Any architect will tell you that the most important part of a good building is a solid foundation. It's the same for a good education. Children need a solid foundation of essential skills before they even start kindergarten in order to stay on track. Building up this foundation will allow your children to maximize their academic success throughout their entire lives.</p>
    <p> Our Beginners in Class program helps students create a foundation of letter recognition, phonics, vocabulary, shape recognition, number recognition, and counting concepts. They'll also build on core basics with puzzles and games that teach logic and problem-solving skills. Not only will students finish Beginners in Class equipped with the skills and confidence they need to be successful in kindergartenâ€”they'll also have fun along the way.</p>
    <p> Scheduling is flexible; you can choose a single 70-minute session or two 35-minute sessions, and you can also choose to focus on math, English, or both.</p>
