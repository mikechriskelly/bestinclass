   quote: "With private tutoring lessons for the COGAT test, I studied hard and passed. I'm now in the gifted program. My tutor, Laura, helped me through the hard sections and taught me useful strategies. My vocabulary and reading comprehension improved a lot."

    <h2 class="prog-gifted">Is your child ready for a bigger challenge?</h2>
    <p>If your child often is bored with usual tasks or finding school materials too easy, you already know they are academically gifted. Students who challenge themselves and are able to work independently with little direction should likely be tested for their school districtâ€™s gifted program.</p>
    <p>Instructors at Best in Class specialize in making students familiar with the types of questions they will encounter on the entrance exam. Students develop skills to approach these test strategically and efficiently.</p>
