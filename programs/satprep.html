    <h2>SAT Prep Classes</h2>
    <p>This course is designed to give students a competitive advantage over their fellow college applicants and a greater chance of acceptance to the college of their choice.</p>
    <p>Classes can be taken in a private lesson format one-on-one, two students per instructor, or in a group-lesson format with 6 to 10 students.</p>
    <p>Test-taking strategies are introduced to students throughout the course, equipping them with test savvy such as the ability to identify clue, trigger, fluff or identifier words, determine when to skip a question or guess an answer, read efficiently under time constraints and much more.</p>
    <p>With a variety of different activities – including review and class discussion of test techniques, practical concept applications and a series of practice tests (over 2,000 practice questions!) – Best in Class students become familiar with the different concepts they will be presented with and are able to think critically about how to effectively approach the questions.</p>
