    <h2>Gifted Test Prep Classes</h2>
    <p>If your child often is bored with usual tasks or finding school materials too easy you already know they are academically gifted. Students who challenge themselves and are able to work independently with little direction should likely be tested for their school districtâ€™s gifted program.</p>
    <p>Our Bellevue, Issaquah, Bothell and Redmond Centers offer gifted test preparation (applicable to Prism, Quest, E2, APP, Spectrum, Discovery and EAP) and specialize in making students familiar with the types of questions they will encounter on the entrance exam. Students develop skills to approach these test strategically and efficiently.</p>
