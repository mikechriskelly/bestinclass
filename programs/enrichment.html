      <h1>English Lessons</h1>
      <p>Once a week, students will participate in a small-class setting with an instructor who has an English degree for 60 to 75 minutes. Best in Class’ proprietary English enrichment curricula matches each student’s abilities with classmates at the same level so they can collaborate throughout the course of the program and improve together.</p>
      <p>Students will be presented with activities that promote applied knowledge rather than memorization; therefore new skills taught are consistently paired with exercises in application of those skills.</p>
      <p>Students are encouraged to develop reading, writing and critical thinking skills at a gradually increased level of difficulty throughout the program, allowing them to build up their vocabulary and master standard English grammar.</p>

      <h1>Math Lessons</h1>
      <p>Once a week, students will participate in a small-class setting with an instructor who has a math degree for 60 to 75 minutes. Best in Class’ proprietary math enrichment curricula matches student’s abilities with classmates at the same level so they can collaborate throughout the course of the program and improve together.</p>
      <p>Instead of memorizing numbers and steps, students are encouraged to master mathematical concepts and then apply them to real-world situations through a combination of hands-on classroom learning, supplemental homework and weekly assessment tests that allow the instructor to consistently track progress and identify areas of improvement.</p>
      <p>Whether a student is at the Pre-Algebra or Pre-Calculus level, he or she will develop the confidence to think critically about how to solve problems and then apply this learning to their everyday life – ultimately preparing them for success in college and beyond.</p>
