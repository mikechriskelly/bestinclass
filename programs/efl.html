    <h2>TOEFL & IELTS Prep</h2>
    <p>The TOEFL and IELTS are required by most four-year institutions in the United States for non-native English speakers, but preparing for them can be a bit scary for some students.</p>
    <p>This course (available at all Washington locations) is separated into eight 90-minute lessons and designed to hone skills in each of the four sections covered on the test: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Students will learn the essential comprehension, reading, verbal and writing skills to tackle each portion of the test with confidence.</p>
    <p>Specific areas of focus include identification of main ideas, vocabulary development, effective structure and support of arguments (both written and spoken), and the proper style/tone/pronunciation.</p>
    <p>Classes can be taken in a private-lesson format (one-on-one or with two students per instructor) or in a group-lesson format with 3 to 5 students.</p>
