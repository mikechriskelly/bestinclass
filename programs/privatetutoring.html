    <h2>Tutoring Sessions</h2>
    <p>Tutoring sessions are one hour long and provide students one-on-one dedicated time with the instructor. Students have the option of sharing their session with one other student if the area of focus is the same.</p>
    <p>Whether a student is struggling with a particular subject or exceling and looking to move to the head of their class, tutoring sessions are uniquely tailored based on individual needs.</p>
    <p>Instructors work with students to improve in areas of need while simultaneously teaching them new study and problem solving skills to enable them to think more independently when faced with academic challenges.</p>
