    <p>What could be better than having a teacher all to yourself? Our one-on-one private tutoring offers students the most individualized instruction possible. Need help with school homework? No problem.</p>
    <p>Need to prepare for a big exam? We've got your back. Want lessons custom designed just for you? You've got it. With private tutoring, you call the shots.</p>
    <p>If you've got a big test on the horizon, private tutoring is especially beneficial. We offer specially designed test-preparation modules through private tutoring for a wide array of exams, including the SAT, AP tests, TOEFL, ISEE, SSAT, ITBS, and CogAT.</p>
    <p>We have tutors available for almost any academic subject you can imagine. You can also focus on specific skills, like essay writing. You can bring in homework or projects you already have for one-on-one guidance, or your tutor can create lessons from scratch to suit your needs.</p>
