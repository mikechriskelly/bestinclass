            New  center In Katy, Texas
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="postmeta">05 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><p>The second Best in Class center in the state of Texas is now open in the city of Allen.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Entrepreneur and owner-operator, Priya Venkat will facilitate the opening in her local community. The education center will welcome the public from 10:30 am to 4 pm on opening day so that parents can learn about the various education programs offered at Best in Class while enjoying complementary drinks and snacks. Additionally, the first 30 people in attendance will enter a chance to win one of three exciting grand prizes which include a $100 gift certificate to Adventure Landing theme park, an iPod Nano, and an Amazon Kindle.</p>

<p>“We’ve seen the excitement and energy here in Texas after we opened our first location in Katy earlier this year, and we’re thrilled to see the same momentum backing Best in Class in the Allen-Plano area,” Hao Lam, Founder and CEO said. “Priya is the perfect addition to the Best in Class system. With her strong appetite for scholarly success, I believe wholeheartedly that students will achieve and surpass their goals in the classroom.”</p>

<p>Venkat comes to Best in Class from a background in Biochemistry, but her history with the brand extends back to 2007 when she enrolled her own children into the program. While working as a clinical researcher in Seattle, WA. Venkat pursued the Best in Class program after realizing the curriculum her kids were receiving in school fell short of a challenge. After seeing her children’s academic improvement as a direct result of the Best in Class teachings, Venkat decided to take it upon herself to bring the brand to the Allen-Plano area after she and her family chose to relocate to Texas.</p>

<p>“As one of the original ‘Best in Class moms’ I have seen firsthand the progress and triumphs achieved in their classrooms. Through my experience, I hope to inspire families here in the Allen-Plano to seize that same success,” Venkat said.  “Competition exists in the educational segment, but while other programs offer repetitive and outdated curriculum, we emphasize critical-thinking and cultivate an environment that nurtures student growth.”</p>

<p>Best in Class was founded on the simple goal of providing the best education possible to each student entering its classroom doors.  The brand’s reputation as the leader in supplemental education has held true through Lam’s tailored curriculum and the centers’ emphasis on cognitive learning. Materials used in class highlight reasoning, critical thinking, and problem solving, allowing students to retain information well beyond their adolescent academic years. This all-inclusive approach has elevated Best in Class to be the parents’ brand of choice when looking for high quality complementary education.</p>

<p>“Our ability to grow nationally is a direct result of the success we’ve seen in each child, in each classroom, across each state,” Lam said. “With the opening of our Allen-Plano location, we hope to inspire the minds of those who come into our centers and we take great pride in knowing that one day, these students will have the potential to achieve great things.”  </p>

<p>Best in Class currently has 25 centers operating in California, Maryland, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. The brand is looking to open additional high-caliber education centers throughout the U.S.  </p>

            Test Prep For Gifted Students
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="postmeta">22 Aug 2013</span>
        <p><p>For many years, Best in Class Education Center has successfully assisted students in gaining entrance to gifted programs in multiple school districts. The Gifted Test Preparation program is currently available at many of our Best in Class locations. Test prep is available all year and at all locations through our private tutoring program. For students in kindergarten through fourth grade, Best in Class Education is holding its Gifted Test Prep courses this fall at our Bellevue, Issaquah, Bothell, and Redmond locations.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>For some students, a regular curriculum seems too easy. These students quickly grow bored and have difficulty concentrating. A gifted program can provide the challenges these students need to thrive. The local gifted programs are perfect for students who are advanced in school and in need of a challenge. However, these programs are highly competitive to get into.  In order to qualify for these programs, a student will normally be required to pass rigorous examinations and score in the highest percentile. Some districts require that students score in the 99th percentile in order to be accepted into the program. Best in Class Education Center helps students prepare for these exams with test-taking strategies, practice tests, and instruction to help give students the best chances of being accepted.</p>

<p>Best in Class Education can give students an advantage to enter the following programs and many more:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PRISM: This program is available to Bellevue students in fourth grade or higher and pairs gifted students with qualified teachers and similarly gifted peers.</li>
  <li>Quest: Students in grades K-12 in the Lake Washington School District can be accepted in this gifted program that focuses on English and math.</li>
  <li>E2: Math students in grades three through six participate in this gifted program, which encourages independent, accelerated learning.</li>
  <li>APP: The Seattle Public School’s Accelerated Progress Program (APP) centers on language arts, math, science, and social studies for gifted students in first through twelfth grades.</li>
  <li>Spectrum: Seattle Public School’s Spectrum program challenges first-graders through eighth-graders with a rigorous curriculum that encourages students to learn one grade above in both reading and math.</li>
  <li>Discovery: In the Renton school district, gifted students in this program spend at least 225 minutes a week learning at an accelerated pace.</li>
  <li>EAP: The Elementary Advanced Program (EAP) provides a self-contained classroom for gifted students in grades two through sixth.</li>
</ul>

<p>We help students by providing step-by-step approaches to the types of questions commonly found on the exams. In addition, we prepare for the testing atmosphere by providing good test-taking strategies for high-pressure environments.</p>

<p>There are many types of tests a student may be required to take when applying for a gifted program. Students may be tested on cognitive aptitude, reading comprehension, verbal or quantitative reasoning, and learning abilities.</p>

<p>Through the Best in Class Gifted Test Prep programs, students are able to enter the testing process with more confidence. The test-taking strategies taught in the Gifted Test Prep class are strategies that can be carried over into the classroom as well, helping reduce test anxiety and increasing a student’s success.</p>
