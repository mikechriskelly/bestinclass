For many years, Best in Class Education Center has successfully assisted students in gaining entrance to gifted programs in multiple school districts. The Gifted Test Preparation program is currently available at many of our Best in Class locations. Test prep is available all year and at all locations through our private tutoring program. For students in kindergarten through fourth grade, Best in Class Education is holding its Gifted Test Prep courses this fall at our Bellevue, Issaquah, Bothell, and Redmond locations.

For some students, a regular curriculum seems too easy. These students quickly grow bored and have difficulty concentrating. A gifted program can provide the challenges these students need to thrive. The local gifted programs are perfect for students who are advanced in school and in need of a challenge. However, these programs are highly competitive to get into.  In order to qualify for these programs, a student will normally be required to pass rigorous examinations and score in the highest percentile. Some districts require that students score in the 99th percentile in order to be accepted into the program. Best in Class Education Center helps students prepare for these exams with test-taking strategies, practice tests, and instruction to help give students the best chances of being accepted.

Best in Class Education can give students an advantage to enter the following programs and many more:

* PRISM: This program is available to Bellevue students in fourth grade or higher and pairs gifted students with qualified teachers and similarly gifted peers.
* Quest: Students in grades K-12 in the Lake Washington School District can be accepted in this gifted program that focuses on English and math.
* E2: Math students in grades three through six participate in this gifted program, which encourages independent, accelerated learning.
* APP: The Seattle Public School’s Accelerated Progress Program (APP) centers on language arts, math, science, and social studies for gifted students in first through twelfth grades.
* Spectrum: Seattle Public School’s Spectrum program challenges first-graders through eighth-graders with a rigorous curriculum that encourages students to learn one grade above in both reading and math.
* Discovery: In the Renton school district, gifted students in this program spend at least 225 minutes a week learning at an accelerated pace.
* EAP: The Elementary Advanced Program (EAP) provides a self-contained classroom for gifted students in grades two through sixth.

We help students by providing step-by-step approaches to the types of questions commonly found on the exams. In addition, we prepare for the testing atmosphere by providing good test-taking strategies for high-pressure environments.

There are many types of tests a student may be required to take when applying for a gifted program. Students may be tested on cognitive aptitude, reading comprehension, verbal or quantitative reasoning, and learning abilities.

Through the Best in Class Gifted Test Prep programs, students are able to enter the testing process with more confidence. The test-taking strategies taught in the Gifted Test Prep class are strategies that can be carried over into the classroom as well, helping reduce test anxiety and increasing a student’s success.
