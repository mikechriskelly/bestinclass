Entrepreneur and owner-operator, Priya Venkat will facilitate the opening in her local community. The education center will welcome the public from 10:30 am to 4 pm on opening day so that parents can learn about the various education programs offered at Best in Class while enjoying complementary drinks and snacks. Additionally, the first 30 people in attendance will enter a chance to win one of three exciting grand prizes which include a $100 gift certificate to Adventure Landing theme park, an iPod Nano, and an Amazon Kindle.

“We’ve seen the excitement and energy here in Texas after we opened our first location in Katy earlier this year, and we’re thrilled to see the same momentum backing Best in Class in the Allen-Plano area,” Hao Lam, Founder and CEO said. “Priya is the perfect addition to the Best in Class system. With her strong appetite for scholarly success, I believe wholeheartedly that students will achieve and surpass their goals in the classroom.”

Venkat comes to Best in Class from a background in Biochemistry, but her history with the brand extends back to 2007 when she enrolled her own children into the program. While working as a clinical researcher in Seattle, WA. Venkat pursued the Best in Class program after realizing the curriculum her kids were receiving in school fell short of a challenge. After seeing her children's academic improvement as a direct result of the Best in Class teachings, Venkat decided to take it upon herself to bring the brand to the Allen-Plano area after she and her family chose to relocate to Texas.

“As one of the original ‘Best in Class moms’ I have seen firsthand the progress and triumphs achieved in their classrooms. Through my experience, I hope to inspire families here in the Allen-Plano to seize that same success,” Venkat said.  “Competition exists in the educational segment, but while other programs offer repetitive and outdated curriculum, we emphasize critical-thinking and cultivate an environment that nurtures student growth.”

Best in Class was founded on the simple goal of providing the best education possible to each student entering its classroom doors.  The brand’s reputation as the leader in supplemental education has held true through Lam’s tailored curriculum and the centers’ emphasis on cognitive learning. Materials used in class highlight reasoning, critical thinking, and problem solving, allowing students to retain information well beyond their adolescent academic years. This all-inclusive approach has elevated Best in Class to be the parents’ brand of choice when looking for high quality complementary education.

“Our ability to grow nationally is a direct result of the success we’ve seen in each child, in each classroom, across each state,” Lam said. “With the opening of our Allen-Plano location, we hope to inspire the minds of those who come into our centers and we take great pride in knowing that one day, these students will have the potential to achieve great things.”  

Best in Class currently has 25 centers operating in California, Maryland, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. The brand is looking to open additional high-caliber education centers throughout the U.S.
